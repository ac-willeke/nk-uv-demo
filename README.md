A demonstration of Python DevOps practices using automated tools and workflows. This repository shows Python project structure, code quality enforcement, security scanning, and CI/CD pipelines.

## Features

- **Python Tooling** - uv for dependency management
- **Code Quality** - Ruff, mypy, pytest with testing
- **Security** - Security scanning and monitoring
- **CI/CD Pipeline** - Automated testing, building, and deployment
- **Developer Tools** - Pre-commit hooks, VS Code integration, Taskfile automation
- **Documentation** - Guides and implementation details

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) - Python package manager
- [Task](https://taskfile.dev/installation/) - Task runner (optional)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/) account

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
gh repo clone ac-willeke/nk-uv-demo
cd nk-uv-demo

# Development setup (installs dependencies, hooks, runs checks)
task dev-setup

# Test the application
task run
# â†’ "Hello from nk-uv-demo!"

# See all available commands
task --list
```

### Key Commands

```bash
task check            # Run all quality checks
task test-html        # Run tests with coverage
task build            # Build Python package
```

For complete command reference, see [Command Cheatsheet](docs/command-cheatsheet.md).
